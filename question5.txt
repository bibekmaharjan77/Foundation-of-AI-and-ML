Geometric Viewpoint:

- The volume scaling factor of the transformation denoted by A is det(A)∣.

- If the transformation is negative, it also flips the orientation, much like a mirror flip.

- There is no distinct inverse for zero; instead, space is compressed into a smaller dimension.

Algebraic Viewpoint:

It is defined for alternating (row swap flips sign), multilinear (linear in each row), and square matrices.

- All determinant definitions are essentially the same due to their uniqueness.

My preferred definition of a determinant is: 

A unique combination of multilinearity, alternation, and det(I)=1 determines the determinant, which is the signed volume scaling factor.

usecases:

- Matrix inversion

- ML transformations known as Jacobian determinants

- Eigenvalue formulas

- In statistics, determining feature independence and covariance
